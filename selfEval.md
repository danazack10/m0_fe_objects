# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?\
*I'm surprised that it's ended this quickly! It felt hard at times but also satisfying to solve something that required outside research.*
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?\
*My workflow is going well so far. I'm taking adequate breaks and I'm naturally good at focusing on one task at a time (vs. multitasking).*
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?\
*I want to remember some of the specific syntax. It was hard for me to realize that objects within arrays are still only separated by commas. I was inclined to put a semi-colon between them because the code blocks in between each array element was large.*
